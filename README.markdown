RefineryCMS Djatoka
==================

0. Create a [RefineryCMS](http://refinerycms.com/) application

1. Add the djatoka and refinerycms_djatoka gems to your Gemfile:

```
gem 'djatoka'
gem 'refinerycms_djatoka', :git => 'TODO'
```

2. `bundle install`

3. Add config/initializers/djatoka.rb with your own Djatoka resolver for different
environments:

```
if Djatoka.respond_to? :resolver
  Djatoka.resolver="http://african.lanl.gov/adore-djatoka/resolver"
end
```

4. Override `app/views/refinery/admin/_javascripts.rb` with:

`rake refinery:override view=admin/_javascripts`

5. Edit `app/views/refinery/admin/_javascripts.rb` to include this at the very top:

```
<%= javascript_include_tag 'admin_override' -%>
```

6. Edit `app/views/refinery/admin/_javascripts.rb` to include this after 'refinery/wymeditor':

```
<%= javascript_include_tag 'wymeditor_en' -%>
```

7. Add this line to your config/initializers/refinery/core.rb file:

`config.register_stylesheet "djatoka_custom", :media => 'screen' `

8. Optional: If you would like the Djatoka image to link to an external page or a page
  within your Refinery project, then you will need to create a Javascript
  function Djimage.url_creator(filename). Here's my simple function:
  
```
Djimage.url_creator = function(filename){
  return 'http://d.lib.ncsu.edu/collections/catalog/' + filename;
}
```

You will place this in `app/assets/javascripts/djimage_url.js` and then edit 
`app/views/refinery/admin/_javascripts.rb` to include this after 'wymeditor_en':

```
<%= javascript_include_tag 'djimage_url' -%>
```


9. Give it a try. If you are just trying it out with the lanl.gov resolver, you can use this 
  identifier to test it:

info:lanl-repo/ds/ffbe88c3-ab45-4358-8bc1-a5a742cc1487


TODO
====

1. Figure out how to do things like include the javascript in a saner way than this!
2. Figure out how to test an extension of WYMeditor for Refinery.
